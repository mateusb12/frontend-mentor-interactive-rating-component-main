## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

There is a concept called document flow. 

If I ever need to change the current content to another one, I can simply 
- Stack both contents on top of each other
- Start the document with the upper element visible
- Press the button, force the upper element to have `[display: none]`
- The bottom element will be `removed from the document flow`, making room for the bottom element to occupy its space

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving on the document flow concept, by practicing more examples.
